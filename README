We've accomplished a lot in the first week. We have

- Event modeled are way through the gamut of carousel use cases, and narrowed it down to three representatives
- Stubbed out the HTML for each.
- Nailed down how to describe UI components in markup.
- Validated our work with other webdevs
- Held design sessions for other components
- Identified alternate notations (that could make Athena even more sexy)
- And, best of all we've left a trail of documentation that will be essential in Athena's adoption.

To git Athena: https://github.com/Iheartweb/AthenaUIFramework
(node server.js and go to http://localhost:3000/carousel_a.html to see it in action)

- Complete Carousel and it's base component, List.
- Complete Tabs ( manages List ).
- Design Reveal.
- Stub out Dialog and Callout.
- Continue to validate our work getting web dev feedback.
- Continue the document goodness.
